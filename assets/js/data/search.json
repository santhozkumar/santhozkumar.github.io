Much bigger more resources.On Master Nodes, important K8s processes are running. more important. so have the backup of master in prod environments.Kubernetes master: the master manages the scheduling and deployment of application instances across nodes, and the full set of services the master node runs is know as the control plane. The master communicates with nodes through the kubernetes API server. The scheduler assigns nodes to pods depending on the resource and policy constraints you’ve defined.Kubelet : Each node runs an agent process called a kubelet, that’s responsible for managing the state of the node: starting, stopping and maintaining application containers based on instructions from control plane. It receives information from the kubernetes API server. API Server - which also a contianer, entrypoint to K8S cluster, different kubernetes clients will talk to this via UI, API, or CLI. Controller manager - keeps track of whats happening in the cluster. detects cluster changes i.e. if any pod dies. Controller Manager —&gt; Scheduler —&gt; where(node) to put pod? —&gt; Kubelet Scheduler - scheduling containers on different nodes based on work load, available server resources. ensures Pods placement. Schedule new pod —&gt; API Server —&gt; Scheduler —&gt; where to put the pod? —&gt; kubelet starts the pod etcd — basically holds anytime the current state of the cluster. holds all the configuration data, state data of each container on each node. Backup and restore is made from this etcd snapshots kubernetes backing key-value store. What resources are available?Did the cluster state change?is the cluster healthy?all these informations are stored in etcd.Virtual Network which enables master and work nodes to talk to each other. Creates on unified machine. each node has multiple Pods on it 3 processes must be installed on every Node, that are used to schedule and manage those pods Container runtime — like Docker or something Kubelet interacts with both - the container and node. it schedules the process. it starts the pod with a container inside Kube Proxy - forwarding requests from services to Pods.

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created.Pod, Services and IngressNode — physical or virtual serverPod — smallest unit of K8s Abstraction over container usually 1 application per Pod Each Pod gets it’s own IP address New IP address on re-creation — it;s a disadvantage when Pod is dead, new ip created. So service helps to overcome thisService : Permanent IP address attached to each Pod Also acts as a load balancer lifecycle of Pod and Service not connected. even pod dies, ip address stay.Ingress :request first goes to ingress, it does the forward invent to the service.allows to name the website. image Config Map and SecretConfigMap : external configuration of your application DB_URL = mongo-dbSecret : used to store secret data, stored in base64 encoded. DB_USER = mongo-user or DB_PASSWORD = mongo-passwordUse the above as environment variables or as a properties file.Volumes:if the DB restarted, data is gone. so attach a local or remote storage volume to the DB Pod.K8S doesn’t manage data persistance, our responsible to backup or replicate the data in external hardwareDeployment and Stateful SetReplicate Everything on multiple nodesDeployment :Replica is connected to the same Service(permanent Ip, load balancer)define blueprints for my-app pods —&gt; which is called as deploymentsdeployment is the abstraction of pods.DB can’t be replicated via Deployment. because DB have state, so use Statefulset to avoid data inconsistencies.StatefulSET :for StateFull apps or Databases. which read and writes are synchronized.Deploying Statefulset not easy, so often host DB outside of K8s cluster and do deployents of Stateless applications.Benefits of K8s.
