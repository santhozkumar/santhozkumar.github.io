### What is 'Systemd'?
- It's an init system
- The init system is the process running on your server(PID 1)
- It manages all services that run in the background

### Working with Units
- Units in Systemd are resources that it's able to manage.
- These includes services, timers, mounts, automounts, and there's more

### Frequent commands

#### Start/Stop/Service
`systemctl status <service-name>` to check the status  
`systemctl start <service-name>` to start the service  
`systemctl stop <service-name>` to stop the service  
`systemctl restart <service-name>` to restart the service  

#### Enable/Disable
`systemctl enable <service-name>`  to start the service while booting  
`systemctl disable <service-name>`  to not start the service while booting   

enabled by default in ubuntu/Debian, disabled by defaults in Fedora/Centos

### Where are unit files stored?
service files are text files that contain instructions on how systemd needs to manage the service.  
**Systemd Unit Directories**   
1. /etc/systemd/system  -- 
2. /run/systemd/system  -- contains runtime systemd units
3. /lib/systemd/system  -- anytime you install a library and it contains systemd service file, that's stored here

If all three directories conains a same service file name, it takes priority as above order.  
when need to override the config of the installed lib service, write a new service file in the higher priority ***unit directories***. Because when updating the library via apt, the service file in lib will be overwritten.
